# AmbaSplegg
A splegg minigame plugin. (Yes, it's a HiveMC wannabe)

My goal with this project is to break it apart as an API under the name AmbaGamesAPI.

With this, I've gained some understanding how to utilize Maven.
I also have learned to utilize Macros to build artifacts and automatically upload them through an SFTP connection.

ESSENTIAL TODO
- Configurable Map Manager
- Vote Manager

FANCY TODO
- Fix up Message Manager
- Scoreboard Manager
- Title Manager
- Item Manager (AmbaEconomy?)
- Leaderboard Manager (AmbaLeaderboards?)
